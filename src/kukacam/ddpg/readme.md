### DDPG Algorithm for Kuka Environment

- Tensorflow 2.x code
- Actor-Critic model
- DDPG & PER algorithms

These codes **do not** work as desired. They don't provide any significant improvement
even after running the code for more than 10k episodes. I also
tried implementing Prioritized Experience replay (PER) without much success.

It is report in [this](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8461039?casa_token=iDx0fIt7XkkAAAAA:0yfMeSTW_eLAUxEIVZiJlJ6t2HvLFhlq9tYtlscrnYkd8x_iufw27JPLIk01lblHEtERxIs-4_0) article that DDPG is not very stable.

This code is made available to help others who would like to improve on this.

Best wishes,
Swagat
